## Testing 

I have tested the codes of both HTML and CSS a couple of times. on CSS the errors i got at first were the font-size not having a percentage at the end meaning it has to end with a unit. another one was having the width and style of the image in the HTML and the validator recommended me i should move them to CSS.
beside this no error was found. the header logo is set as home page. when you click it, it takes you to the home page. All the navigation link work properly and represent their own page. All the links on the footer work properly and opens the social media site in a new tab. The video include does not play without you touching it and muted until you play it. All the benefits are listing in a well-manned way which makes it easier for people to read it and understand the concept. The course page shows the user the schedule of the course, when and where the course takes place. The site is tested on all devices from mobile phone to destkop and it works properly and all the functions are there, it does not matter what type of device you are using, it works. 

I found it hard to put the logo i made on the header because it was taking up all the same so i decided to put the logo on the cover text and on the header, i just used the text logo.

Google font on my project is embedded on the html instead of the css way because the google font link keeps on override any properity it comes next, so at first i tried to put it at the end of the page but that didn't work so i decided i should put it on the HTML file


### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fnu%2F%3Fdoc%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcode-institute-org.github.io%252Flove-running-2.0%252Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en#css)

### Unfixed Bugs

i had a hard time while working on this and found some bugs i wouldn't fix, for example the burger icon for the mobile screen, it was working properly but wasn't visible. After a few days of not understanding why it is not visible, i finally found out why, it is because the background-color and the color of the burger icon was the same, there were both white. The mockup screenshot i have used for this README. file is not best one because website keeps bringing out pictures with something wrong with it and then i would go and see the live version and there is nothing wrong with it. so i believe i have done everything i can.
