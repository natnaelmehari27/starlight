                    <h3>Enhancing fitness</h3>
                    <hr>

                    <p>
                        Yoga is known for its ability to soothe tension and anxiety in the mind and body. But it can
                        also have an impact on a person's exercise capacity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        yoga's emphasis on gentle stretches and dynamic movements significantly improves flexibility and
                        enhances joint mobility. Incorporating yoga postures into your warm-up or cool-down routine at
                        the gym helps reduce the risk of injuries and enhances your overall performance during other
                        workouts. Looser muscles also aid in better posture and balance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Researchers studied a small group of sedentary individuals who had not practiced yoga before.
                        After eight weeks of practicing yoga at least twice a week for a total of 180 minutes,
                        participants had greater muscle strength and endurance, flexibility, and cardio-respiratory
                        fitness.

                    <h3>Cardiovascular benefits</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        Several small studies have found yoga to have a positive effect on cardiovascular risk factors:
                        it helped lower blood pressure in people who have hypertension. It's likely that the yoga
                        restores "baroreceptor sensitivity." This helps the body senses imbalances in blood pressure and
                        maintain balance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another study found that practicing yoga improved lipid profiles in healthy patients, as well as
                        in patients with known coronary artery disease. It also lowered excessive blood sugar levels in
                        people with non-insulin dependent diabetes and reduced their need for medications. Yoga is now
                        being included in many cardiac rehabilitation programs due to its cardiovascular and
                        stress-relieving benefits.

                    <h3>Mental benefits</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        Aside from the physical benefits, one of the best benefits of yoga is how it helps a person
                        manage stress, which is known to have devastating effects on the body and mind. “Stress can
                        reveal itself in many ways, including back or neck pain, sleeping problems, headaches, drug
                        abuse, and an inability to concentrate,” says Dr. Nevins. “Yoga can be very effective in
                        developing coping skills and reaching a more positive outlook on life.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Yoga’s incorporation of meditation and breathing can help improve a person’s mental well-being.
                        “Regular yoga practice creates mental clarity and calmness; increases body awareness; relieves
                        chronic stress patterns; relaxes the mind; centers attention; and sharpens concentration,” says
                        Dr. Nevins. Body- and self-awareness are particularly beneficial, she adds, “because they can
                        help with early detection of physical problems and allow for early preventive action.”
